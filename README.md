# hello-world
(This repository is for practising Github Flow.)

Hi! Welcome to my repository, my name is Kuda. 
I am a biological sciences graduate who is very
passionate about personal development and entrepreneurship.
Recently I discovered that I have a strong passion 
for software development and computers. So I started 
learning programming. At first I followed a self-taught 
programme I created using ChatGPT, but I quickly got overwhelmed 
and I quit. Then in March I enrolled with The Odin Project.
I really am enjoying my studies now and am looking forward to 
Completing my study programme and get a good job as a 
software developer.
